The methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has long been known as a dangerous nosocomial pathogen. We develop a synteny-based algorithm that detects newly inserted DNA sequences from whole genome sequencing data with high accuracy. We applied our method to the sequencing data of 14 isolates in a recent study of an MRSA outbreak and used these insertion signatures to construct the phylogenetic tree of these isolates.
